    	Aliasing&Phenomenon where a reconstructed signal appears at a lower frequency than the original due to a non-compliance of the Nyquist theorem.\\\\%Analog and DSP Ashok Ambardar
    	Algorithm&Set of rules that state the steps and operations to carry a particular task.\\\\
    	Artifact&Recorded activity that is not of cerebral origin. They can be divided into physiologic and extraphysiologic artifacts.\\\\%https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1140247-overview
    	(digital) filter&A lineal and invariant system that separate the frequency components from its input, which is determined by its parameters selected.\\\\%DSP John G. Proakis
    	EEG&Measurement of brain electrical fields via electrodes (which act as small antennas) placed on the head.\\\\%EEG_Generalities/Where Does EEG Come From...
        Imagined speech&Silent expression of conscious thought to oneself in a coherent linguistic form.\\\\%Imagined_Brain_Areas/What is that little voice...
        Overt speech&Physical articulation and production of phonemes and/or words.\\\\%Imagined_Overt_Comparisons/Critical Review...
        Phoneme&Smallest unit of speech distinguishing one word (or word element) from another.\\\\%https://www.britannica.com/topic/phoneme
        Realization&A particular temporal function from a random process. For EEG data is a particular channel signal.\\\\
        Sample&In this work is considered the set of channel signals from a particular subject, class and trial (or repetition).\\\\
        Signal&Any physical magnitude that varies in time, frequency or any other independent variable or variables. In this work will be a synonym of a realization.\\\\%DSP John G. Proakis
        Wavelet&Oscillating amplitude function that is relatively localized and limited in both time and frequency.%Wavelets/Wavelet analysis of neuroelectric...
